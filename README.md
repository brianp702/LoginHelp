# Login help
Login help is a single page JS app (jQuery/AJAX) for users that forgot their login credentials.

It does much more that recover a password. It is made for a very secure system where each user has an account number, username, password, email, security questions, and 2 factor authentication. 

I built it for a client. I have permission to publish the frontend code. I don't have permission to publish the backend logic, which was written in ColdFusion. It had a lot of interesting business logic involving security, SQL queries, decryption, password history, failed login attempts, and 2 factor authentication (Google's implementation).
